# 🔬 Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression

This project applies **logistic regression** to classify breast cancer tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using the Breast Cancer Dataset from Kaggle. 

## 📌 Project Overview

- Load and explore the dataset
- Preprocess and clean the data
- Train a logistic regression model
- Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualize the results

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the [Logistic Regression To detect Breast Cancer](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sahityasetu/logistic-regression-to-detect-breast-cancer/notebook) available via Kaggle.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – data manipulation
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) – numerical operations
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) – machine learning
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) – plotting
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) – statistical visualization

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JessicaComfortGrant/Breast_Cancer_Project.git

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the notebook
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Breast_Cancer_Analysis.ipynb

## 📈 Model Evaluation

- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report (precision, recall, f1-score)
- Visualizations for data distribution and model performance

## 📷 Sample Visualizations
